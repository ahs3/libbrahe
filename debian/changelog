libbrahe (1.3.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. 
  * Lintian fixes: removed article 'a' from short description
  * Lintian fixes: add build-arch build-indep targets to debian/rules
  * Lintian fixes: since autoconf files are regenerated during build
    to ensure correct build behavior, note that properly in debian/source.
  * Closes: Bug#643181 -- this FTBS was due to the autoconf changes that
    should now be handled properly.
