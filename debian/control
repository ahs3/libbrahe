Priority: optional
Maintainer: Al Stone <ahs3@debian.org>
Build-Depends: debhelper (>= 4.0.0), doxygen

Package: libbrahe-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Depends: libbrahe-1.2-0 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: a heterogeneous C library of numeric functions
 This library provides:
 .
   * a function for rounding floating point values to a specific number
     of digits
   * several pseudo-random number generators, including the Mersenne
     Twister, various algorithms by Marsaglia, and ISAAC
   * least common multiple and greatest common denominator functions
   * a few trigonometry functions for finding the inversions of hyperbolic
     sine, cosine, and tangent
 .
 This library is also used by libevocosm, which is in turn the 
 foundation for Acovea, used to determine optimal compiler optimizations
 .
 This package contains the files needed to develop code using libbrahe.
